     * This can happened when:
     *   - The table connected to the datasource.
     *   - A manual call to `PblDataSource.refresh()` was invoked.
     *
     * There are additional triggers (filter/sort/pagination) which occur when their values change, e.g. when
     * a filter has change or when a page in the paginator was changed.
     *
     * By default, these triggers are handled automatically, resulting in a client-side behavior for each of them.
     * For example, a client side paginator will move to the next page based on an already existing data collection (no need to fetch from the server).
     *
     * To handle additional trigger you need to explicitly set them using `setCustomTriggers`.
