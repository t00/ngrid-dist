/**
 * In charge of handling the lifecycle of detail row instances.
 * The whole lifecycle: Create, update, move, destroy, etc...
 *
 * This controller also sync's the rendering process to make sure we reuse detail rom elements within
 * a single rendering cycle (i.e. not long term caching but a short term one).
 * This is done for performance and to prevent flickering when a row is moved into a different element due to virtual scroll.
 * When this happen we just want to move all dom elements properly, swap the context and trigger change detection.
 * If we have left over rows to render we create new elements or if we have left over rows to clear, we remove them.
 * The logic for this relay on the fact that the row's context.$implicit is updated in a sync iteration by the cdk table
 * and afterwards we will have the onRenderRows event fired, allowing us to sync changes.
 * We also relay on the fact that the event run immediately after the iterations and everything is sync.
 *
 * > In the future, this is where we can support detail row caching
