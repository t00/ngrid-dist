     * - ignore: don't do anything, leave as is (for manual intervention)
     * - close: close the detail row
     * - render: re-render the row with the new context

     * This scenario will pop-up when using pagination and the user move between pages or change the page size.
     * It might also happen when the data is updated due to custom refresh calls on the datasource or any other scenario that might invoke a datasource update.
     *
     * The `ignore` phase, when used, will not trigger an update, leaving the detail row opened and showing data from the previous row.
     * The `ignore` is intended for use with `toggledRowContextChange`, which will emit when the row context has changed, this will allow the developer to
     * toggle the row (mimic `close`) or update the context manually. For example, if toggling open the detail row invokes a "fetch" operation that retrieves data for the detail row
     * this will allow updates on context change.
     *
     * Usually, what you will want is "context" (the default) which will remember the last state of the row and open it based on it.
     *
     * > Note that for "context" to work you need to use a datasource in client side mode and it must have a primary/identity column (pIndex) or it will not be able to identify the rows.
     *
     * > Note that `toggledRowContextChange` fires regardless of the value set in `whenContextChange`
